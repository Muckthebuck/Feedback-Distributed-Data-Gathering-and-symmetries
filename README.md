# Feedback Distributed Data-Gathering and symmetries
This project investigates feedback-based distributed data-gathering architectures and explores fundamental symmetry principles in physics. It combines coding-based simulation of feedback vs. non-feedback systems and analytical proofs in classical mechanics rooted in Noetherâ€™s theorem.
